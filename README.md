# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction 💰  
A **Streamlit-powered web app** that predicts laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and more. This project is built using **machine learning models** trained in **Jupyter Notebook** and deployed with an interactive UI for users to input specifications and get price estimates.

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Interactive **Streamlit** web app for real-time price predictions  
✅ **Jupyter Notebook** for data preprocessing, visualization, and model training  
✅ Uses **machine learning models** like Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.  
✅ Clean and well-documented **Python code**  
✅ Dataset exploration and insights with **matplotlib & seaborn**
